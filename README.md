This is my setup for [jwilder's `nginx-proxy`](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy), with the following:

* Automated SSL using [JrCs' `docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion`](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion)
* Working examples
    * WordPress
    * Gogs

This repo is meant to show simple examples of how to quickly use the reverse proxy and deploy your own websites in minutes.

## Requirements

1. A remote server hosted somewhere, eg. Digital Ocean, AWS, etc.
    * [Get $10 credit with Digital Ocean using my referral link!](https://m.do.co/c/5ef3660ba5b6)
1. The domain(s) you want to host, registered with a domain registrar such as Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed on the remote server

More instructions coming soon.
